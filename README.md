### What is this repository for? ###

This is in install script for arch linux, meant for personal use. Mount future root partition to /mnt, and mount all other subdirectories (/home, /boot) in /mnt. Create a swap mount and use `swapon /dev/swap_partition`. Clone the repository and run arch-deploy.sh. It will install the minimal working environment (wifi, terminal, git).
